# Machine-Learning-Assignment
# Overview 
1) You are provided with a dataset of tumour measurements 
2) The aim of this assignment is to build some classifiers and evaluate their performance. The classification task is to predict whether a tumour is malignant (M) or benign (B). 
3) Using the sklearn library, you will build the following classifiers 
  • a naive Bayes classifier 
  • a nearest neighbours classifier 
  • a decision tree classifier 
  • a support vector machine classifier

# Instructions 
Required libraries 
1) python 3.5 or up
2) pandas  # sudo pip3 install pandas
3) numpy   # sudo pip3 install numpy
4) sk-learn  # sudo pip3 install sklearn
5) scipy   # sudo pip3 install scipy

When you run the program in terminal please use following steps
1) code file is assignm.py
2) dataset should include in same dir
3) run in python 3 (sudo python3 assignm.py)
